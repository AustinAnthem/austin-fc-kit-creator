# Austin FC Kit Creator

If you're like me, you can't WAIT until Austin FC release their first official kit. Since I can't I wait, [I made this kit creator so we can make our own](austin-fc-kit-creator.netlify.app). This tool allows you to design a kit by choosing your own selections from the toolbar or randomize it and start from there (hit Enter or Directional Arrows at any time to randomize as well). Either way, hope you have fun and let's GROW THE LEGEND!
